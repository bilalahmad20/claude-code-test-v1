# Claude Code Test - V1

## About This Project

This is my first project created with Claude Code. It's a learning sandbox where I'm exploring Git, GitHub, and Claude Code as a complete beginner.

## What I'm Learning

- Git basics (commit, push, pull)
- GitHub (repositories, issues, pull requests)
- Claude Code integration
- Terminal/command line basics

## My Skill Level

- Complete beginner with Git and terminal
- Explain things simply and step-by-step
- Don't assume I know technical jargon

## Project Setup

- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/bilalahmad20/claude-code-test-v1
- **Claude GitHub App:** Installed and working
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/claude.yml` triggers on `@claude` mentions

## How I Like to Work

- Explain what you're doing before you do it
- Break tasks into small steps
- Use tables and bullet points for clarity
- Confirm with me before making big changes
